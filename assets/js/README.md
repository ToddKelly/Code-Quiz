Code Quiz README
This Repo alows a user to complete a timed multiple choice quiz. 
When the user enters a question correctly a point is added to their total score and time is added to the quiz timer. 
When the user answers a question incorrectly, time is subtracted from the quiz timer. 
If the timer runs out completely, the quiz ends. 
When the quiz ends the user is able to enter their name. 
Their name is then posted to the list of high scores along with the score they achieved. 

Here is a link to the live application: https://github.com/ToddKelly/Code-Quiz.git
